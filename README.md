# Blender-MBTL-BG-Import
This is a Blender add-on to import the .fbx.json files from the game Melty Blood: Type Lumina to Blender.
The imported geometry won't display perfectly on blender since blender is rendering the objects in its own order and the objects with alpha transparency / addictive blending are not correctly blended.

## Requirements:
* Blender 4.0 (May work with other versions)
